Perform a comprehensive **audit of the entire codebase** to check if the architecture is clean, modular, and optimized:

- Identify any files, components, or logic that are in the wrong place or could be better organized. Are there any instances of code that donâ€™t belong in their current file (misplaced logic)?
- Evaluate if we have a clear separation of concerns (e.g., data handling vs UI vs state management). Point out any overly coupled sections of code.
- Highlight any areas of the code that are overly complex or not following best practices.
- Provide a report with specific recommendations to improve structure and maintainability, **without making any code changes yet**.

Break down the suggestions into an ordered list of steps we could take, from most critical to optional enhancements.
