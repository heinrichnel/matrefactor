# Component Classification Example

This example shows how specific files would be classified in the new structure.

## Example: CustomerReports.tsx

**Current location:** `/src/components/CustomerManagement/CustomerReports.tsx`

**New location:** `/src/components/CustomerManagement/reports/CustomerReports.tsx`

**Classification rationale:**
- This component visualizes data using charts
- It displays analytical information about customers
- It's focused on reporting metrics rather than data entry
- It contains multiple visualization sections (Revenue, Trip Volume, etc.)

Since CustomerManagement doesn't have a dedicated "reports" directory in our structure, we could either:
1. Add a "reports" directory to CustomerManagement
2. Move it to "pages" as it's a complex display component

The recommended approach would be to add a "reports" directory for consistency, since this is clearly a reporting component.

## Example: TripDeletionModal.tsx

**Current location:** `/src/components/Tripmanagement/TripDeletionModal.tsx`

**New location:** `/src/components/TripManagement/modals/TripDeletionModal.tsx` 

**Alternative location:** `/src/components/TripManagement/pages/TripDeletionModal.tsx`

**Classification rationale:**
- This is a modal dialog component
- It handles a specific UI interaction (trip deletion confirmation)
- It's not a form (although it contains form elements)
- It's not a full page

This example shows that we might want to consider adding more subdirectories beyond just "forms" and "pages" for some domains. For modals, we could either:
1. Add a dedicated "modals" directory 
2. Place them in "pages" as they're part of the UI

## Example: AddNewTyrePage.tsx

**Current location:** `/src/pages/Tyremanagementpages/add-new-tyre.tsx`

**New location:** `/src/components/TyreManagement/pages/AddNewTyrePage.tsx`

**Classification rationale:**
- This is a page component that renders a form
- It handles form submission and navigation
- It's a top-level UI component

## Recommended Refinement to Our Structure

Based on these examples, we might want to refine our structure to include additional directories for certain domains:

```
components/
├── DomainManagement/
│   ├── forms/    # Form components
│   ├── pages/    # Page and layout components
│   ├── modals/   # Modal dialogs
│   ├── tables/   # Table components
│   ├── cards/    # Card components
│   └── reports/  # Reporting components
```

However, to start with, the forms/pages distinction is a good foundation, and we can add more specialized directories as patterns emerge in the codebase.
