## Firebase Data Structures

### Tyre Data Structure
Based on the type definitions in `src/types/tyre.ts`, the Tyre data should be structured as follows in Firebase:

```typescript
interface Tyre {
  id: string;
  serialNumber: string;
  dotCode: string;
  manufacturingDate: string;
  brand: string;
  model: string;
  pattern: string;
  size: TyreSize;
  loadIndex: number;
  speedRating: string;
  type: TyreType;
  purchaseDetails: {
    date: string;
    cost: number;
    supplier: string;
    warranty: string;
    invoiceNumber?: string;
  };
  installation?: {
    vehicleId: string;
    position: TyrePosition;
    mileageAtInstallation: number;
    installationDate: string;
    installedBy: string;
  };
  condition: {
    treadDepth: number;
    pressure: number;
    temperature: number;
    status: 'good' | 'warning' | 'critical' | 'needs_replacement';
    lastInspectionDate: string;
    nextInspectionDue: string;
  };
  status: 'new' | 'in_service' | 'spare' | 'retreaded' | 'scrapped';
  mountStatus: 'mounted' | 'unmounted' | 'in_storage';
  maintenanceHistory: {
    rotations: TyreRotation[];
    repairs: TyreRepair[];
    inspections: TyreInspection[];
  };
  milesRun: number;
  kmRunLimit: number;
  notes: string;
  location: TyreStoreLocation;
  createdAt?: Timestamp;
  updatedAt?: Timestamp;
}
```

### Inventory Item Data Structure
Based on the type definitions in `src/types/inventory.ts`, the Inventory Items should be structured as follows in Firebase:

```typescript
interface InventoryItem {
  id: string;
  sageId?: string;
  name: string;
  code: string;
  quantity: number;
  unitPrice: number;
  category: string;
  reorderLevel?: number;
  status?: 'active' | 'inactive';
  stockValue?: number;
  location?: string;
  lastReceived?: string;
  createdAt?: string;
  updatedAt?: string;
}
```

## Empty Pages Identified

Based on the screenshots provided and the code analysis, the following pages appear to be empty or under development:

1. **Safety Inspections**
   - Screenshot shows "This feature is currently under development"
   - No corresponding file found in the codebase for this specific page

2. **DOT Compliance**
   - Screenshot shows "This feature is currently under development"
   - No corresponding file found in the codebase for this specific page

3. **Audit Management**
   - Screenshot shows "This feature is currently under development"
   - No corresponding file found in the codebase for this specific page

## Implementation Status

1. **Workshop/Inspections Page**: There is a file at `/workspaces/APppp/src/pages/workshop/inspections.tsx`, but it seems this is separate from the Safety Inspections page shown in the screenshot.

2. **Missing Firebase Implementation**: While the type definitions exist for both Tyre and Inventory items, the implementation of Firebase CRUD operations for these entities appears to be missing from the `firebase.ts` file. Functions for Diesel records and Trips are implemented, but not for Tyres or Inventory items.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Create the missing pages:
   - `/src/pages/compliance/safety-inspections.tsx`
   - `/src/pages/compliance/dot-compliance.tsx`
   - `/src/pages/compliance/audit-management.tsx`

2. Implement Firebase CRUD operations for Tyres and Inventory items similar to the existing functions for other entities:
   - `addTyreToFirebase`
   - `updateTyreInFirebase`
   - `deleteTyreFromFirebase`
   - `addInventoryItemToFirebase`
   - `updateInventoryItemInFirebase`
   - `deleteInventoryItemFromFirebase`

3. Connect the UI components to the Firebase data.
