# Heavy Vehicle Fleet System: Integration Plan

This document provides guidance on ensuring robust integration between the various functional modules in the Heavy Vehicle Fleet System.

## 1. Centralized Routing Architecture

To maintain a robust and maintainable system, the routing architecture follows these principles:

### Component-to-Route Relationship

- Each route in `App.tsx` should map to exactly one component
- Routes in the sidebar should match routes defined in `App.tsx`
- Component names should follow a consistent pattern (e.g., `[Name]Page.tsx` for pages)

### Avoiding Duplication

- Consolidated duplicate files (like `TripDashboard.tsx` and `TripDashboardPage.tsx`)
- Components with similar functionality should be abstracted into shared components
- Common functionality across different modules should be moved to utility functions

## 2. Module Integration Strategy

### Core Business Operations

#### Trip Management Integration Points

- **Trip Dashboard**: Central entry point integrating with all trip-related subsystems
- **Trip Planning**: Integrated with Driver Management for scheduling and availability
- **Active Trips**: Linked to Wialon for real-time location tracking
- **Trip Completion**: Connected to Invoice Management for automatic invoice generation

#### Diesel Management Integration Points

- **Fuel Logs**: Synchronized with Trip data for per-trip fuel efficiency calculations
- **Theft Detection**: Connected to Driver Management for linking to responsible drivers
- **Carbon Footprint**: Integrated with reporting engine for compliance reports

#### Invoice Management Integration Points

- **Invoice Creation**: Pulls data from completed trips and diesel costs
- **Paid Invoices**: Connects with financial systems for reconciliation
- **Tax Reports**: Integrated with compliance reporting

### Operational Systems

#### Workshop Management Integration Points

- **Job Cards**: Linked to Fleet data for vehicle history
- **Inspections**: Connected to Driver Management for inspection assignments
- **Parts Ordering**: Integrated with Inventory Management

#### Tyre Management Integration Points

- **Tyre Performance**: Uses data from Trip Management for wear analysis
- **Inspections**: Integrated with Workshop for scheduled maintenance

### External System Integrations

#### Wialon Integration

- **Unit Data**: Synced with Fleet Management for consistent vehicle records
- **Real-time Tracking**: Connected to Trip Management for active trip monitoring
- **Driver Behavior**: Linked to Driver Management for performance tracking

## 3. Shared Services Architecture

### Data Synchronization

- All modules use the common `SyncProvider` to maintain offline capabilities
- Changes in one module propagate to related modules through the sync service

### Error Handling

- Centralized `ErrorBoundary` captures and reports errors from all modules
- Domain-specific error handlers extend the core error handling

### Authentication and Authorization

- Single sign-on across all modules
- Role-based access controls applied consistently

## 4. Implementation Requirements

### Navigation Structure

- The sidebar in `Sidebar.tsx` provides the primary navigation structure
- Child routes are properly nested under their parent sections
- Navigation state persists across sessions

### Consistent UI Components

- All modules use shared UI components for consistent look and feel
- Forms follow consistent validation and submission patterns
- Data tables share common filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities

### Offline Capabilities

- Critical operations function offline through the sync service
- UI clearly indicates sync status to users

## 5. Module Status and Integration Priorities

### High Priority Integration Points

1. Trip Management → Invoice Management → Financial Reporting
2. Workshop Management → Inventory Management → Purchase Orders
3. Wialon Integration → Trip Management → Driver Management

### Medium Priority Integration Points

1. Tyre Management → Workshop Management
2. Diesel Management → Trip Management
3. Customer Management → Invoice Management

## 6. Integration Testing Strategy

### Automated Integration Tests

- End-to-end tests for critical business workflows
- API integration tests for backend services
- Component integration tests for complex UI interactions

### Manual Testing Scenarios

- Cross-module workflows (Trip creation → Completion → Invoice generation)
- Offline mode testing for all critical operations
- Mobile-specific testing for field operations

## 7. Integration Verification Process

Before deploying new features:

1. Run automated tests covering affected modules
2. Execute the integration check script to identify issues
3. Verify all routes render without errors
4. Test offline capabilities for affected modules

## 8. Continuous Integration Practices

- Daily builds verify cross-module integration
- Integration metrics tracked over time
- Automated notifications for integration failures
