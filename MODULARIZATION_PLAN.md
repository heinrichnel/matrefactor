- [ ] Document Upload Form

## 2. Duplicate Pages to Consolidate

### Priority 1: Frequently Used Pages

- [x] TripDashboard/TripDashboardPage
- [x] AddTripPage
- [ ] CustomerReports pages
- [ ] DriverDetails pages
- [ ] DieselDashboard pages
- [ ] RetentionMetrics pages

### Priority 2: Less Used Pages

- [ ] VehicleTyreView/VehicleTyreViewA

## 3. Implementation Steps for Each Form

1. **Create Firestore Data Hooks**
   - Create hooks for fetching data from Firestore
   - Implement loading and error states
   - Add data transformations if needed

2. **Create Form Component**
   - Implement form with proper validation
   - Add loading/submitting states
   - Integrate with Firestore data hooks
   - Add offline support
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness

3. **Integrate with Host Page**
   - Add modal trigger (button, link, etc.)
   - Implement modal for form display
   - Add success/error handling
   - Update list view after form submission

4. **Clean Up Duplicates**
   - Add redirect notices to old pages
   - Update routes configuration
   - Remove unused imports
   - Clean up after successful testing

## 4. Testing Plan

1. **Functionality Testing**
   - Verify form validation works
   - Test data loading and submission
   - Check offline capabilities
   - Verify data shows up in Firestore

2. **UI/UX Testing**
   - Test responsive behavior
   - Check accessibility features
   - Verify consistent styling

3. **Edge Case Testing**
   - Test with empty datasets
   - Test with large datasets
   - Test network failure scenarios
   - Test concurrent edits
