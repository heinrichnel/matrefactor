## Responsive Design Patterns

- **Mobile-first approach**: Base styles target mobile devices with progressive enhancements for larger screens
- **Responsive typography**: Smaller text on mobile with incremental increases for larger displays
- **Flexible layouts**: Layout switching with flex-col/flex-row based on screen size
- **Conditional rendering**: Simplifying UI on mobile by hiding non-essential elements
- **Standard breakpoints**: Consistent use of Tailwind's sm, md, lg, xl breakpoints
- **Touch optimization**: Larger interaction targets and proper spacing for mobile
- **Sliding panels**: Bottom sheet pattern on mobile that becomes a sidebar on desktop
- **Overflow handling**: Horizontal scrolling for content that would otherwise overflow

## Testing Guidelines

The responsive design should be tested at these key breakpoints:

- Mobile: 390px width (iPhone 12)
- Tablet: 768px width
- Desktop: 1280px width and above

Key aspects to verify:

1. All content is accessible and readable on small screens
2. UI elements properly reflow and resize
3. Touch interactions work well on mobile devices
4. Maps remain fully functional across all screen sizes
