# Tyre Management Module Implementation Guide

This document outlines the structure of the Tyre Management module and its components.

## Overview

The Tyre Management module provides comprehensive tyre tracking, maintenance, and analytics for fleet vehicles. It consists of several key components:

1. **TyreManagement**: Main wrapper component with tab-based navigation
2. **TyreDashboard**: Overview of key tyre metrics and alerts
3. **VehicleTyreView**: Visual representation of tyres on vehicles
4. **TyreInspection**: Recording tyre inspections and condition
5. **TyreInventory**: Managing tyre stock levels
6. **TyreReports**: Generating reports and analytics on tyre performance

## Component Structure

```

├── TyreDashboard.tsx        # Overview dashboard with key metrics
├── TyreInventory.tsx        # Inventory management
├── TyreInventoryStats.tsx   # Statistics for inventory
├── TyreInventoryFilters.tsx # Filters for inventory
├── TyreInspection.tsx       # Inspection form and history
├── VehicleTyreView.tsx      # Visual representation of tyres on vehicles
├── TyreReports.tsx          # Reports and analytics
└── hooks/                   # Custom hooks for tyre data
```

## Data Structure

The tyre management system uses the following key data types:

1. **Tyre**: Core data structure representing a single tyre
2. **TyreInspection**: Recording of inspection details
3. **TyreStoreLocation**: Enum for storage locations
4. **FleetTyreMapping**: Vehicle-tyre position mapping

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Core Inventory Management
   - Basic inventory listing
   - Tyre search and filtering
   - Stock level monitoring

2. **Phase 2**: Vehicle Integration
   - Vehicle tyre position mapping
   - Installation/removal tracking
   - Vehicle-specific views

3. **Phase 3**: Inspection and Maintenance
   - Inspection forms and history
   - Maintenance scheduling
   - Alerts for maintenance needs

4. **Phase 4**: Analytics and Reporting
   - Performance reports
   - Cost analysis
   - Lifespan predictions

## Best Practices

1. Use the `useTyres()` context hook for accessing tyre data throughout the application
2. Ensure proper error handling with LoadingIndicator and ErrorMessage components
3. Implement responsive design for all components
4. Follow the established design system (Card, Button, etc.)
