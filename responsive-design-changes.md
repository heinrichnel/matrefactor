- **Mobile-first approach**: Default styles for mobile with media queries for larger screens
- **Responsive typography**: Using smaller text on mobile with sm: variants
- **Flexible layouts**: Switching from vertical to horizontal layouts using flex-col/flex-row
- **Conditional rendering**: Hiding complex UI elements on mobile
- **Tailwind breakpoints**: Consistent use of sm, md, lg, xl breakpoints
- **Touch-friendly targets**: Larger buttons and spacing for mobile interactions
- **Sliding panels**: Mobile-specific bottom panels for detailed information
- **Horizontally scrollable elements**: For tabs and content that would overflow on mobile
