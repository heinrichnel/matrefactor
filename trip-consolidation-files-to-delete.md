# Files to Delete After Trip Management Consolidation

This document lists files that can be safely deleted after the trip management functionality has been consolidated into the new `TripManager.tsx` component.

## Trip Management Pages

These pages have been replaced by the consolidated TripManager component:

- `src/pages/trips/ActiveTripsPageEnhanced.tsx` - Replaced by ActiveTrips tab in TripManager
- `src/pages/trips/TripManagementPage.tsx` - Main page replaced by consolidated TripManager
- `src/pages/trips/MainTripWorkflow.tsx` - Workflow now managed by TripManager tabs
- `src/pages/trips/LoadPlanningComponentPage.tsx` - Functionality now available through TripManager
- `src/pages/trips/RouteOptimizationPage.tsx` - Functionality now available through TripManager
- `src/pages/trips/RoutePlanningPage.tsx` - Functionality now available through TripManager
- `src/pages/trips/TripTimelinePage.tsx.swp` - Temporary file that can be deleted

## Trip Management Components

These components have been consolidated into the TripManager:

- `src/components/TripManagement/TripDashboard.tsx` - Dashboard functionality moved to TripManager
- `src/components/TripManagement/LoadPlanningComponent.tsx` - Planning functionality now in TripManager
- `src/components/TripManagement/RouteOptimization.tsx` - Consolidated into TripManager
- `src/components/TripManagement/TripRouter.tsx` - Routing handled by TripManager's tab structure
- `src/components/TripManagement/TripTemplateManager.tsx` - Templates now managed by TripManager

## Components Still in Use

The following components are still used by TripManager and should **NOT** be deleted:

- `src/components/TripManagement/ActiveTrips.tsx` - Used by TripManager's active tab
- `src/components/TripManagement/MissedLoadsTracker.tsx` - Used by TripManager's missed loads tab
- `src/pages/trips/CompletedTrips.tsx` - Used by TripManager's completed trips tab
- `src/pages/trips/TripCalendarPage.tsx` - Used by TripManager's calendar tab
- `src/components/TripManagement/TripTimelineLive.tsx` - May be used by timeline functionality

## Implementation Notes

When deleting these files, ensure that:

1. The AppRoutes.tsx file has been updated to use the new TripManager component
2. Any imports of deleted components in other files are updated
3. The sidebar navigation points to the correct routes

After completing the trip management consolidation, we should next focus on:

1. Driver Management consolidation
2. Workshop Management consolidation
3. Inventory Management consolidation

These sections also have significant duplication that could be streamlined using the same tab-based approach.
